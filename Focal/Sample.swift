// Should sample Nvidia's daltonization technique for deutan and protan
// Figure out Tritan later

// Figure out Nvidia's method so we can precompute lower levels of CVD
// Figure out how to use Oklab (perceptual) instead of YCbCr (linear) color space
// ^ This should also help with luminance issues and may make computation simpler
